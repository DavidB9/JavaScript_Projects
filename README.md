# Pizza Menu
This project is a meny used to order pizza with variious selection of toppings. It takes the
input from the user with them selecting the size and toppings and then uses this information to
calculate the price of the order.

# Tic-Tac-Toe Game
This project is the classic game of tic-tac-toe. A user can select one of 9 squares which will then allow the AI to select a random square. The first to line up three of their symbol wins.

# Calculator
This project is a basic 4 function calculator. Users can add, subtract,multiply, and divide on web version of a calculator.
